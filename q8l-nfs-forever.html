Now don't get me wrong, I respect women and everything but it seems that with them you can dive into deep conversations only so deep before you realize that they're not really getting it (at best/trying to be polite), at worst. well at worst is the majority of the cases. Anyway, you can never have as intellectual/philosophical conversation with a woman as you could with a man. And if you could, well she'd be one in a million.

I've been looking for a racing game that ideally is free but could also be less than -30 that has car customization and solid racing mechanics. I really enjoyed NFS World (free) but quit when it was obviously trying to make the game painful for you unless you paid real money and when the cars "statistics" were completely worthless (i.e. a "300 speed" car was faster than a "400 speed" car or the "400 handling" car was a tank compared to a "300 handling" car. I'm looking at you, Dodge Charge. saved Trying to troubleshoot NFS taking 20-30 seconds to mount between two servers. iperf shows 941mbit/s, performance is fine once mounted and uid based security is working correctly, but if unmounted it again takes 20-30 seconds to mount. One forum suggested it could be because it is attempting kerberos auth (which I do not have set up) before timing out, and I have seen other sites mentioning NFS is DNS dependent which seems to have an odd hiccup.

I was going to spend some time writing a post about emo rock and its influence on modern pop music (which will still happen at some point), but before doing so I recently noticed that UKF Music was celebrating their 10th anniversary this month. They posted about it earlier this year (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wiuzc7madRM), but UKF created their dubstep YouTube channel on April 29th. For those who aren’t familiar with UKF Music, they’re a big deal in the world of electronic music. Short. </p>
